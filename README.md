# Podcast Generator

![Podcast Generator](docs/images/Podcast%20designer.jpeg)

Podcast Generator is a web application that allows users to extract text from a document in PDF or website, generate a podcast conversation outline using Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o (current model), and convert the outline into an audio file using Azure Cognitive Services.

## Features

- Extract text from a given PDF or Website
- Generate a podcast conversation outline between two speakers discussing the extracted content.
- Allow users to edit the generated outline before converting it to audio.
- Convert the edited outline to an audio file using Azure Speech Service
- Save the generated audio file with a unique timestamp and allow user to download it

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Flask
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- OpenAI Python client
- Azure Cognitive Services Speech SDK

You will need an Azure subscription and create the following resources:
- Azure Blob Storage #To host the audio files
- Azure OpenAI # To generate the scripts of the podcast
- Azure Intelligent Document # to Extract text and context from the pdf files (optional)
- Azure Speech Service #To generates the audio files 

Also, your running machine needs to have installed ffmpeg, so to avoid problems, is recommended to run in DevContainers


## USE DEV CONTAINER

This repo contains the devContainer config to run it correctly without any inconvenience as a container in your desktop. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/frdeange/PodCastSecurityv2.git
    cd PodCastSecurityv2
    ```
2a) If you have docker in your computer and WSL available, is recommended to run the folder as container


2b. If not docker or you don't want to use container, enable a virtual environment into your development environment to execute the code

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up your environment variables for OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Services:

Its recommended to create a .env files on your project root that contains at least the following fields:

 ```#Azure OpenAI Required Params
AZURE_OPENAI_TYPE="azure" # azure or openAI
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY="YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="YOUR_API_VERSION" 
AZURE_OPENAI_ENGINE="gpt-4o" # Like gpt-4o or model you deployed

#Azure Intelligent Document Required Params
AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY="YOUR INTELLIGENT DOCUMENT KEY"
AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT="YOUR INTELLIGENT DOCUMENT ENDPOINT"

#Azure Speech Required Params
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY="YOUR SPEECH SERVICE KEY"  
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION="YOUR SPEECH SERVICE region" # For example swedencentral 

#Azure Storage Required Params
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="YOUR CONNECTION STREAM"
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME="YOUR BLOB CONTAINER NAME"
 ```
## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. Use the web interface to:
    - Extract text from a website by providing the URL or uploading a .pdf file
    - Generate a podcast conversation outline.
    - Edit the generated outline if necessary.
    - Convert the outline to an audio file.
